For the correct display in the **Infobar** the XPicons folder is required!

The large XPicons (220x132 32Bit) can be copied to one of the following directories:

* USB flash drive: / media / usb / XPicons / picon / (Recommended)
* HDD: / media / hdd / XPicons / picon / (may cause longer loading times if the hard drive is in standby.)
* Internal flash: / usr / share / enigma2 / XPicons / picon /

The regular size (100x60 32Bit) should be one of the following directories:

* USB flash drive: / media / usb / picon / (Recommended)
* HDD: / media / hdd / picon / (may cause longer loading times if the hard drive is in standby.)
* Internal flash: / usr / share / enigma2 / picon /
